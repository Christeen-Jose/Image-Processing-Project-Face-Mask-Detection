# Attendance and Face Mask Recognition System
This project aims to provide a solution to help companies keep track of their employees' adherence to Covid-19 guidelines. The system uses face mask recognition technology to detect whether an employee is wearing a mask or not upon entry into the company's premises. The system also keeps track of the number of employees that have entered the building to prevent overcrowding.
## Motivation
The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the world in an unprecedented way, with the virus being highly contagious. To prevent its spread, it is recommended that people wear masks and maintain social distance while in public. These guidelines have been provided by the CDC. Our motivation for this project is to help companies ensure that their employees are adhering to these guidelines to protect their health and well-being.
## Goal
Our goal is to provide a software tool that companies can use to keep track of their employees and whether they are adhering to Covid-19 guidelines. This is essential to protect employees' lives and ensure the company's production is not impacted by a virus outbreak among its employees
## Solution
Our solution is a face mask recognition system that captures an employee's picture upon entry into the company's premises. The system uses this picture to recognize the employee and detect whether they are wearing a mask or not. If an employee is not wearing a mask, the system alerts the company to take appropriate action. The system also keeps track of the number of employees that have entered the building to prevent overcrowding.
## Code Implementation
Our system is implemented in Python language, and the following are the important Python modules that form the core of our implementation:
* Dataset.py: This module is used to save all the face images captured by the system.
* faceMask_detection.py: This module is used to detect whether an employee is wearing a mask or not.
* train_image.py: This module is used to train the captured images and work on datasets.
* recognize.py: This module is used to recognize employees and mark attendance.
* automail.py: This module is used to send email notifications to a specific email address.
## Have a look on the application!
